# Networking basics #0

## Introduction
This repository is about our project on Pyhton language after many months learning C programming language at Holberton School.

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using ```wc```

## Tasks and Prototype
### Tasks 0 to 5

* OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.
* LAN connect local devices together, WAN connects LANs together, and WANs are operating over the Internet.
* Questions:

    - What is a MAC address?

     - The name of a network interface
     - The unique identifier of a network interface
     - A network interface

    - What is an IP address?

     - Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
     - The unique identifier of a network interface
     - Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks

* Letâ€™s fill the empty parts in the drawing above.

    - Questions:

 - Which statement is correct for the TCP box:
    - It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
    - It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
 - Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
    - It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
    - It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
 - Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:
    - Have you received boxes x, y, z?
    - May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?
* Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:
* Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
